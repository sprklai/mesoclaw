# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and maintainers of MesoClaw pledge to make participation in our community a welcoming, respectful, and productive experience for everyone, regardless of background, experience level, or identity.

## Our Standards

**Expected behaviors:**

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

**Unacceptable behaviors:**

- Personal attacks or insults
- Trolling or deliberately disruptive comments
- Publishing others' private information without permission
- Any conduct that would be considered unprofessional in a collaborative environment

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that violates this code.

Maintainers have the right to remove, edit, or reject contributions (comments, commits, issues, etc.) that do not align with this Code of Conduct, and to temporarily or permanently ban contributors for conduct they deem inappropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces (GitHub Issues, Pull Requests, Discussions, and any official communication channels) and also applies when an individual is representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported by opening a GitHub Security Advisory or contacting the maintainers listed in `SECURITY.md`. All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Project maintainers who do not enforce this Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent consequences as determined by other members of the project leadership.
