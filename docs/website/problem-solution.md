# Problem / Solution

## The Problem
Most AI assistants stop at conversation. Teams still lose time switching tools, repeating context, and manually executing multi-step tasks. Sensitive workflows are hard to trust in black-box systems, and production use often breaks when you need approvals, auditability, or channel-based collaboration.

## The MesoCLAW Solution
MesoCLAW brings OpenClaw's open, agentic model into a practical product workflow. It combines conversation, memory, tools, and execution controls in one platform so your team can move from prompt to completion. With self-hosted options, BYOK/local model support, approval-aware execution, and multi-channel delivery, MesoCLAW helps you automate high-value work without sacrificing control.
